Old story

When i was a child, i lived in a small fairytale village. The village was so peaceful. I enjoyed my life there. The people was hunting, selling, and making our village more beautiful. I walked and ran in every early mornings. It was very funny when i saw sheeps, cows, horses in our farm. I thought i had a peaceful life.
Then one day, we found some animals which was dead by unknown reasons. As the days pasted, we found more and more dead animals. We were trying to investigate the reasons.
But it was not long that strange creatures came to our village. This was the first time that we had seen the creatures. The creatures were attacking some people arround our village. We were so surprised and scary, so we called them monsters. We had to protect our village. So the battle between people and monsters began.
We began to make some towers, castles, traps. We were also making some swords, spears, bows, arrows. We had to prepare before fighting monsters. But it took more times than we thought. The monsters destroyed our buildings. Our family members were dead...
We were so sad because of those which were happening. I was the only one who escaped from hell. My parents were killed. The people were all dead. I had nothing more than a father's old guide book. He gave me before he died. He said that it would help me in the future. I did cry. I should have saved my village and my parrents.
I decided to travel all arround this dangerous world because i had to move to a better place.
Until now, thanks to my father's old guide book, I can create more things than i think. I am building another fairytale place in order to remember my village and people. I am traveling arround this dangerous world in order to know more about the world...
The monsters have not been defeated yet. We are trying to make this world better...
